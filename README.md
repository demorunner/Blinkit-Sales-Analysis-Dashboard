### Project Overview üöÄ

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal is to identify actionable insights and optimization opportunities by leveraging various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and data visualizations in Power BI.

### Data Source üìÅ

The analysis is based on the following dataset:

* `BlinkIT Grocery Data.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the raw data used to create the Power BI dashboard, including details on sales, items, outlets, and customer ratings.

### Key Metrics (KPIs) üìà

The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were used to measure performance:

1.  **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2.  **Average Sales:** The average revenue per sale.
3.  **Number of Items:** The total count of different items sold.
4.  **Average Rating:** The average customer rating for items sold.
